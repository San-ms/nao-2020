        <div class="text-project">
          <p>
            Following my interest on the intersections of design and activism I wanted to carry out a collaborative project that would bring them together, and would allow me to design WITH instead of FOR people. I made contact with Todopoderosa and Satélite LAT, two collectives that fight for an increased participation and visibility of women* in the music industry in Colombia and Latin America.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">The first action was to find a way to include decision makers from the industry (mostly men) in the gender parity conversation. As long time activists, they knew it was very difficult to engage in dialogue with them because of their lack of interest or because they simply did not perceive the invisibility of women in music as a problem at all. For this reason, we made a direct action at Circulart, one of the most important music fairs in Latin America, and developed different strategies to carry out discussions with different actors in the music industry.
</p>
          <p class="indent">One of these actions was a guerrilla poster-survey campaign in which we asked people to anonymously express their opinion and tell us about their experience in the music industry in relationship with their gender identity. Placed in the public spaces and restrooms of the venue, after some hours the responses started to show some similarities and patterns in the answers by women, diverse people and men. This made visible that these differences are not only present but they put women and diverse people at a disadvantage. These posters arose interest in this topic and people came to us to start the conversation in other physical and digital spaces outside the few debates included in the fair program, usually organized and visited only by women.
          </p>

          <p class="indent">The second project consisted of the creation of the digital platform “Una y Una”. A network of women and diverse people in the music industry to get more visibility and enable digital and analog networking through a professional directory and a calendar of music related events organized by and/or for women and diverse people. Additionally, we created a blog where resources and articles about activism and collaborative work are shared. This project is still in progress currently looking for funding to finish the platform.
</p>

          <p class="foot-note">*Please note that we understand and use the word women in a vast way meaning cis-women, trans-women and everyone who identifies as a female.
